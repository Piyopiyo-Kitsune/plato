# Extension reference

Flat reference of every plato extension point. One section per surface; no nesting beyond H2 so AI agents can grep and find a single match.

## Slots

### `adminSettingsPanel`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminSettingsPanel`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminPlugins.jsx` (the plugin card)
- **Props:** `{ pluginId: string, settings: object, onSave: (next) => Promise<void> }`
- **When:** the admin expands "Show settings" on the plugin's card
- **Phase:** 1
- **Example:** `plugins/slack/client/SlackSettingsPanel.jsx`
- **Gotchas:** if you don't ship a custom panel, plato auto-renders a form from `manifest.settingsSchema`. Pick one; don't ship both.

### `adminUserRowAction`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminUserRowAction`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminUsers.jsx` — actions cell at the right end of each user row, before the Delete button
- **Props:** `{ user: AdminUser }` (see SDK `AdminUser` type)
- **Phase:** 1
- **Example:** `plugins/teacher-comments/client/UserRowAction.jsx`
- **Gotchas:** the host wraps the slot in a `stopPropagation` container so clicks inside the slot don't trigger the row's edit-user navigation. Plugin components don't need their own `stopPropagation`. The slot only renders for confirmed users — invite rows skip the slot.

### `adminHomeKpi`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminHomeKpi`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminHome.jsx` after `<PacingSection>`
- **Props:** `{}` (KPIs fetch their own data via `/v1/admin/stats/plugins`)
- **Phase:** 2 (declared, not yet rendered)

### `adminProfileFields`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminProfileFields`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminUsers.jsx` — below the form fields on the Edit User page
- **Props:** `{ user: AdminUser }`
- **Phase:** 1.1
- **Example:** `plugins/teacher-comments/client/ProfileField.jsx` (admin comment thread)
- **Gotchas:** the slot mounts inside the same Card as the form fields. Plugin components should structure their own visual separator (e.g., `<Separator />` + section heading) so they don't blend into the form. Multiple plugins contributing to this slot stack vertically in registration order.

### `learnerProfileFields`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.learnerProfileFields`
- **Renders inside:** classroom Settings page
- **Props:** `{ profile: LearnerProfile }`
- **Phase:** 2

### `learnerHomeBanner`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.learnerHomeBanner`
- **Renders inside:** learner home, top of lesson list
- **Props:** `{}`
- **Phase:** 2

## Lifecycle methods

Optional functions a plugin's `server/index.js` default export can declare.
Distinct from event hooks below — these are one-shot host-invoked methods,
not pub-sub events.

### `onActivate(ctx)`

Runs once when admin enables the plugin AND once at boot if the plugin is
already enabled. Idempotent. Use for migrations, cache warmup, seeding. Don't
run heavy work here — it's synchronous in the boot path.

Errors are caught and logged as `plugin_on_activate_failed`; the plugin
continues to run.

### `onDeactivate(ctx)`

Runs when admin disables the plugin. Should release resources, NOT delete
user data. Settings are preserved across disable/enable cycles.

Errors are caught and logged as `plugin_on_deactivate_failed`.

### `onUninstall(ctx)`

Optional. Runs only when an admin uses the "Delete plugin data" flow on
`/plato/plugins`.

- Plugin must be **disabled** first (host refuses otherwise).
- Admin must type the plugin id in a confirm dialog.
- The host clears the plugin's settings/activation entry after `onUninstall`
  completes successfully — every plugin gets that for free.

**Implement `onUninstall` only if your plugin owns data beyond the
activation record** — for example, per-user `userMeta:<id>` records or
`plugin:<id>:*` sync-data namespace records (Phase 3+). For a plugin whose
only state is its settings (e.g. Slack's bot token), no `onUninstall` is
needed; the host's activation-record cleanup is sufficient.

For a plugin that uses `userMeta:<id>`, the cleanup iterates users and
calls `deleteUserMeta`:

```js
async onUninstall(ctx) {
  const users = await db.listAllUsers();
  for (const u of users) {
    if (await getUserMeta(u.userId, ctx.pluginId)) {
      await deleteUserMeta(u.userId, ctx.pluginId);
    }
  }
}
```

**Errors propagate** — unlike `onActivate`/`onDeactivate`, partial-cleanup
failures are surfaced to the admin so they can retry rather than silently
leaving data behind.

The audit log gets a `plugin_data_uninstalled` entry with the admin's user
id and the plugin id.

Available since Plugin API 1.2.0.

## Hooks

The hook bus is at `server/src/lib/plugins/hooks.js`. **Open by design** — any event name works. Plugins MAY emit/subscribe to arbitrary names following the convention `<plugin-id>.<event>`. Core emits a known subset (this list).

### `userCreated`

- **Capability:** `hook.userCreated`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, email: string, role: 'admin' | 'user' }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/auth.js` after `db.createUser` — both the bootstrap-admin path (`POST /v1/auth/bootstrap-admin`) and the invite-accept signup path (`POST /v1/auth/signup`)
- **Fires:** AFTER the user record is persisted. Observe-only; handlers can't abort. Errors in handlers are logged but don't fail the user-facing request.
- **Phase:** 1.1
- **Notes:** Bootstrap admins created at server-startup via env-vars (in `server/src/index.js` and `dev-sqlite.js`) bypass this emit point — the hook bus may not be initialized yet at that boot phase. If you need to react to ALL users including the very first admin, run a sweep on plugin activate.

### `userUpdated`

- **Capability:** `hook.userUpdated`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, updates: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/me.js` PATCH `/v1/me`; `server/src/routes/admin.js` PATCH `/v1/admin/users/:id`
- **Phase:** 2 (capability and bus exist; emit-point not yet wired)

### `profileUpdated`

- **Capability:** `hook.profileUpdated`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, key: 'profile' | 'profileSummary', data: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/sync.js` after PUT of `profile`/`profileSummary`
- **Phase:** 2

### `lessonStarted`

- **Capability:** `hook.lessonStarted`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, lessonId: string, lesson: { name, markdown, exemplar, learningObjectives }, lessonKB: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/sync.js` POST `/v1/sync/lesson-started` — called by `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js#startLesson()` after the Lesson Owner agent initializes the KB but before the Coach opens the conversation
- **Phase:** 1 (wired)
- **Gotchas:** Plugins can use this to enrich the lesson at start time (e.g., fetch external docs, add context from a knowledge base). The lesson markdown and objectives are included so plugins can decide whether to act. Enrichment responses (if the plugin returns data) are collected by the endpoint and stored on `lessonKB.enrichments`. Plugins MUST fail open — errors must never block lesson start.

### `lessonCompleted`

- **Capability:** `hook.lessonCompleted`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, lessonId: string, lessonKB: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/sync.js` on PUT of `lessonKB:<id>` when status flips to `'completed'`
- **Phase:** 2
- **Gotchas:** OBSERVE-ONLY. Hooks fire AFTER the lessonKB is persisted. Plugins MUST NOT participate in the completion decision (that's the coach's job, single-owned by `applyCoachResponseToKB`).

### `coachExchangeRecorded`

- **Capability:** `hook.coachExchangeRecorded`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, lessonId: string, messageCount: number }`
- **Phase:** 3

### `userDeleted`

- **Capability:** `hook.userDeleted`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, email: string, role: 'admin' | 'user' }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/me.js` DELETE `/v1/me`; `server/src/routes/admin.js` DELETE `/v1/admin/users/:id`
- **Fires:** BEFORE the cascade. Plugins can read their own `userMeta:<id>` records before they're deleted by the cascade. The host awaits all handlers before proceeding to delete the user's sync-data and user record.
- **Phase:** 1.1
- **Notes:** The user's `userMeta:*` records are auto-deleted by the cascade — plugins don't need to explicitly clean up. Subscribe to this hook only if you have side effects beyond plato (e.g., notify external systems, archive content).

## Enrichment Pattern

The `lessonStarted` hook + `lessonEnrichment` capability enable a powerful pattern: plugins can inject additional reference material into lessons at start time. The host collects enrichment responses, stores them on `lessonKB.enrichments`, injects them into the coach's system context, and displays them to the learner as collapsible artifact panels.

### Use cases
- **External docs** — fetch WordPress.org docs, React API references, MDN articles
- **Knowledge bases** — query internal wikis, Confluence, Notion
- **Recent updates** — pull latest bug reports, release notes, deprecation warnings
- **Company context** — add org-specific best practices, security policies, code standards

### Contract

A `lessonStarted` hook handler with `lessonEnrichment` capability can return an enrichment object:

```js
{
  pluginId: 'wordpress-info',       // Required: your plugin id
  label: 'WordPress.org',            // Required: display name shown to learner
  context: 'When building custom...',// Required: ~300 word summary for the coach
  reasoning: 'This lesson focuses...', // Required: why this context matters
  sources: [                         // Optional: citation links
    { url: 'https://...', title: '...', excerpt: '...' }
  ]
}
```

**Return `null`** (or omit the return) when your plugin doesn't enrich this lesson. The host filters out nulls — only non-null returns are stored.

### Lifecycle

1. Learner starts a lesson → `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js#startLesson()` calls `POST /v1/sync/lesson-started`
2. Server emits `lessonStarted` hook with `{ userId, lessonId, lesson, lessonKB }`
3. Each plugin handler runs; non-null returns are collected
4. Server returns `{ enrichments: [...] }` to client
5. Client stores `lessonKB.enrichments` (one-time — never re-runs on resume)
6. `buildContext()` injects enrichments into coach system prompt
7. `LessonChat` renders `<EnrichmentArtifact>` above first coach message

### Fail-open requirements

**Plugins MUST fail open** — enrichment errors must never block lesson start. The reference implementation (WordPress Info plugin) demonstrates:

- Planner returns `{ shouldEnrich: false }` → no enrichment (learner sees normal lesson)
- Query executor timeout or API error → empty results → no enrichment
- Synthesizer error → no enrichment
- Hook handler throws → host catches error, logs `plugin_hook_failed`, skips that plugin

### Example: WordPress Info plugin

Three-agent pipeline:
1. **Planner** (`prompts/wordpress-info-planner.md`) — detects WordPress keywords in lesson objectives, outputs `{ shouldEnrich: bool, queries: [{ text, sources }] }`
2. **Query executor** — fetches from wordpress.org REST API, Make WordPress blogs, GitHub code search in parallel
3. **Synthesizer** (`prompts/wordpress-info-synthesizer.md`) — distills results into lesson-specific summary

Hook handler returns enrichment data or `null`. See `plugins/wordpress-info/` for the full implementation.

### Anti-goals

- ❌ Don't override completion semantics — enrichment is informational only; the coach (`applyCoachResponseToKB`) remains the single owner of progress
- ❌ Don't delay lesson start beyond ~3-5 seconds — use timeouts, caching, or background jobs for slow sources
- ❌ Don't inline huge docs — the synthesizer should distill to ~300 words
- ❌ Don't re-run enrichment on every chat turn — it's computed once at start and cached on `lessonKB`

## Server SDK exports (`src/lib/plugins/sdk.js`)

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Hono` | Create routers for `routes` |
| `db` | Database access (read/write sync-data, users) |
| `authenticate` | Auth middleware (verifies JWT) |
| `requireAdmin` | Authorization middleware |
| `generateInviteToken` | Crypto helper for invites |
| `APP_URL` | Public URL of the deployment |
| `hostLogger` | Host's ring-buffer logger (rare — prefer `ctx.logger` for plugin-scoped logs) |
| `WebClient` | `@slack/web-api` client (re-exported for the Slack plugin; third-party plugins should declare their own deps) |
| `getUserMeta(userId, pluginId)` | Read the plugin's per-user record. Returns the stored object or `null`. Capability: `user.metadata.read`. Available since 1.1.0. |
| `putUserMeta(userId, pluginId, data)` | Upsert the plugin's per-user record. `data` must be an object. Capability: `user.metadata.write`. Available since 1.1.0. |
| `deleteUserMeta(userId, pluginId)` | Delete the plugin's per-user record. Capability: `user.metadata.write`. Available since 1.1.0. |

**Per-user storage convention:** `userMeta:<pluginId>` is the canonical key
shape. Each plugin gets one record per user.

**Learner isolation** — `userMeta:*` records are admin-owned. Every learner-
facing path that touches the user's own sync-data excludes them:

  - `GET /v1/sync` (bulk) — filtered out of the listing
  - `GET /v1/sync/:dataKey` (single) — rejected by the key whitelist regex
  - `PUT /v1/sync/:dataKey` — rejected by the key whitelist regex
  - `DELETE /v1/sync/:dataKey` (single) — rejected by the key whitelist regex
  - `DELETE /v1/sync` (bulk reset of own data) — `userMeta:*` preserved
  - `GET /v1/me/export` (download my data) — `userMeta:*` filtered out

The only paths that delete `userMeta:*` are account-deletion (DELETE /v1/me
self-delete; DELETE /v1/admin/users/:id admin-delete) and a plugin's own
`onUninstall` hook. Both account-deletion paths fire `userDeleted` BEFORE
the cascade so plugins can read their data on the way out if needed.

Plugins that want learner-visible per-user data should expose their own
routes.

Adding to this surface is a core change — it widens the public plugin contract.

## Client primitives plugins can import

- `react` (aliased in `client/vite.config.js` to `client/node_modules/react`)
- `@/components/ui/*` — shadcn-style UI primitives (Button, Input, Label, Card, etc.)
- `@/lib/*` — shared client utilities (branding, helpers)
- Relative paths into `client/js/*` (`auth.js` etc.)

## Endpoints

### `GET /v1/admin/plugins`

Admin only. Returns every plugin (enabled, disabled, load-failed) with manifest + settings.

### `PUT /v1/admin/plugins/:id/activation`

Admin only. Body: `{ enabled: boolean }`. Toggles activation. Runs `onActivate`/`onDeactivate`.

### `PUT /v1/admin/plugins/:id/settings`

Admin only. Body: arbitrary settings object. Persists to `_system:plugins:activation.<id>.settings`.

### `GET /v1/plugins`

Authenticated. Returns enabled plugins with sanitized settings (writeOnly fields stripped). Used by the client loader.

### `GET /v1/plugins/extension-points`

Authenticated. Machine-readable inventory of slots, hooks, capabilities, and the host API version. Use this from AI agents to discover what's possible.

### `/v1/plugins/<id>/...`
